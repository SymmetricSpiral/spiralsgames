    <p>Pokemon Glazed</p>
    <p class="instructions">I still can't believe I found a Pokemon game I could embed into this site. This is actually a ROM hack, but I still like it nonetheless. There are controls that show up once you click the controller button, which you can edit. It plays like normal Pokemon, but doesn't save automatically. You need to import/export save files by using the buttons on the top right corner of the game window.</p>

    <p>Gragyriss, Captor of Princesses</p>
    <p class="instructions">Despite the name, I actually think this is a pretty cool game. You play by nourishing a dragon with resources such as sheep, wolves, and grass. Wolves raise attack power, sheep restore health, and grass/apples raise max health. As you progress, things become more and more automated. You fight enemy troops by running into them and using fireball moves. When you win a battle, you earn gold that can be used to upgrade things. You can also obtain 3 princesses that give you unique perks. There is also an endless mode, which I recommend after playing the game through once.</p>

    <p>Diep.io</p>
    <p class="instructions">Probably one of my favorite .io games, you play as a tank that can destroy shapes to gain exp points and upgrades. This is an online game, so you can play FFA and team games. You may need to Ctrl + plus to zoom in.</p>

    <p>A Dark Room</p>
    <p class="instructions">I think that this is a prertty cool game, despite being text-based/idle. I guess you've picked up by now that I like idle games. More specifically, I like games where you can make people do things for you. This game fits that criteria very well. You start in a post-apocalyptic world with a builder, and collect wood to make traps and villages. Over time, people move in and you can assign them jobs. Adventures are unlocked once you obtain a compass, and you can scavenge and get more resources. Turn on "hyper" for x2 speed.</p>

    <p>Bad Time Simulator</p>
    <p class="instructions">Someone on GitHub made a recreation of the Sans bossfight from Undertale and it's pretty accurate. There'd not much I can say about this one. Go fight Sans. That guy's in Meme Clash.</p>

    <p>Big Tower Tiny Square</p>
    <p class="instructions">This is a game I used to play a lot growing up. It's mildly difficult but has a simple goal: jump your way to the top of the tower to claim a pineapple. This game takes quite a bit of time to complete, but I really liked the storytelling and the difficulty level.</p>

    <p>Two</p>
    <p class="instructions">This is probably the stupidest game I've put on here. Dubbed "Reverse 2048", you start with a couple of 2048 and 1024 tiles. Instead of adding the tiles when combined, they divide by two. The goal of the game is to make your way down to two. The strategy and gameplay are the exact same as 2048, and the only things different are the numbers and the score weighting.</p>
