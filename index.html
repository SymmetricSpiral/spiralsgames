    <p class="homepage">Hey! I see you've found my site! Over here is where I put my video games that I've made, so feel free to check them out! :)</p>
    <br>
    <p class="homepage">I kinda made this page after sharing a beta copy of Meme Clash with some of my friends and realized that other people might like it too. So I just decided to make it public.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Questions I get asked a lot:</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>What's Meme Clash?</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="homepage">It's a game that I made that pits eight different meme characters against each other. You can find it under "Games" on the top menu. If I was asked what my life's work was, I'd probably say that.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="homepage">Because its funny.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Why do you use Scratch?</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="homepage">Meme Clash started as a Scratch game, and I didn't want to convert it since I was used to the interface. Technically, now it's a <em>javascript application</em>.</p>
