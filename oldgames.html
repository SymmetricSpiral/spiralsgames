    <h2>Old Things</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Here are some old things I made, before I was very good at coding.</h3>
    <p> Unstable </p>

    <p class="instructions">Basically, there's this character you have to control that has the ability to change gravity. You move him with the WASD keys and change gravity with the arrow keys. The goal of the game is to survive as long as you can by dodging the laser blaster in the middle of the screen.(1p)</p>

    <br>
    <p>Rock Paper Scissors</p>
    <iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/618726707/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen class="scratchgame"></iframe>
    <p class="instructions">This is the fighting game that I made that inspired me to make Meme Clash. I reimagined the classic game of rock,paper, scissors as a fighting game similar to Street Fighter. The 3 different characters do double damage based on how they act in rock, paper, scissors. Use the WASD keys (and G) to control the first player(blue). Arrow keys and M control the second player (red).(2p)</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Dodgeball</p>
    <iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/618727985/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen class="scratchgame"></iframe>
    <p class="instructions">This is one of my favorite Scratch games I've made, and also one of the earliest. In the game, use WASD and Q to control the blue character on the left side of the screen. Use the arrow keys and M to move the red person on the right side. The entire stage is seperated by a black line no one can cross. Dodgeballs spawn in random places at random times, so be sure to pick those up and fire them at your opponent. To help you aim, you can press F (blue) or B (red) to make an arrow pop up on the screen. Additionally, the keys N (red) and E (blue) can help you sprint and dodge objects. Finally, extra hearts have a chance of spawning, so be sure to pick them up so that you don't run out of lives and lose the game!</p>
